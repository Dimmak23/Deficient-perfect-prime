# Deficient Numbers.

A number is considered to be deficient if the sum of its factors is
less than twice that number. 

For Example: 
10 is a deficient number. 
Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10 
Sum is 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18 < 2 * 10 

Tasks: 
(Easy) Write a program to verify whether a given number is
deficient or not. 
(Medium) Write a program to find all the deficient numbers in
a range. 
(Hard) Given a number, write a program to display its factors,
their sum and then verify whether it's deficient or not. 

Program done for hard level, also it made iven harder
by adding option to change multiply const and get also results:
...
Sum(factor1,factor2,...)<1.5*Number
...
Sum(factor1,factor2,...)<2*Number
...
etc.

# Perfect Numbers.

A number is considered to be perfect if the sum of its factors is
equal to that number. 

# Instructions:
1) Input deficient const (float). '0'-prime numbers in the range,
1'-prefect numbers in the range, more than '1'-deificient numbers
in the range;
2) Iput starting point of range (integer);
3) Iput ending point of range (integer); 
4) Look at result.

Enjoy, good luck!
